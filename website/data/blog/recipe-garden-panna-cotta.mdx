<RecipeCard recipe={`
>> name: Garden Panna Cotta
>> time: 3 hours
>> course: snack
>> servings: 10

Bring all the first half ingredients (@Ponthier White Asparagus Purée{208g}, @Unsalted Butter{25g}, @Straus Whipping Cream{25g}, @Icelandic Sea Salt{4g}, @Peas, Blanched and Unshelled{70g} and @Pea Shell Vegetable Stock{150ml}) apart from the gelatine up to a gentle simmer for 5 minutes. Blitz and pass the liquid through a strainer.

Soak the @Bronze Gelatine Leaf{2g} in cold water until soft. Whisk in the gelatine whilst the other ingredients are still warm.

Pour a small amount into the bottom of each serving glass and store in the fridge until it’s fully set, at least an hour.

Blend the @Goats’ Cheese{125g}, @Arbequina Olive Oil{5ml}, @Straus Sour Cream{63g} and seasoning (@Salt{2g} and @White Pepper{1g}) in a blender or food processor. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve. Add @Straus Whipping Cream{63g} and mix.

Pour the mixture into an ISI Whip and screw one ISI cream charger, or 2 chargers if using 1L ISI Whip, and shake vigorously. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Release the goats’ cheese foam from the ISI whip and spoon some of the foam into each glass. Garnish with @Pomegranate Arils{5g}, @Endive{1g}, @Pea Shoots, Picked & Washed{7.5g} and @Edible Flowers, Poppy & Mustard Green{0.5g}.
