2. Soak the gelatine in cold water until soft. Whisk in the gelatine whilst the other ingredients are still warm.
3. Pour a small amount into the bottom of each serving glass and store in the fridge until it’s fully set.

_Goats’ Cheese Foam_

1. Blend the goats’ cheese, olive oil, sour cream and seasoning in a blender or food processor. Pass the mixture through a fine sieve. Add heavy cream and mix.
2. Pour the mixture into an ISI Whip and screw one ISI cream charger, or 2 chargers if using 1L ISI Whip, and shake vigorously.
3. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

_To Serve_

Release the goats’ cheese foam from the ISI whip and spoon some of the foam into each glass. Garnish with the endive, peas, pea shoots and the flowers.
